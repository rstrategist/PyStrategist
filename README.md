# PyStrategist

Welcome to my strategy musings 👋
The repository contains my musings on sytematic strategies and market analysis.

🔭 I’m currently learning about systematic strategies and data science, particularly machine learning applications to solve real world problems.
📈 I've implemented a lot of strategies and will start sharing them here for public use.
💬 Ask me about: Financial markets and strategies, ClimateTech, FinTech, Regenerative Agriculture 😃

The repository leverages on the following existing Python libraries:

pdblp = A great and simple interface to integrate pandas and the Bloomberg Open API
https://github.com/MatthewGilbert/pdblp

ta = A great technical analysis library using Pandas and NumPy
https://github.com/bukosabino/ta
              
backtesting = A great Pyton backtesting library. Still in the early stages of development but great scope to develop.
